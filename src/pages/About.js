              <p>
                I'm a student currently pursuing CDAC. I love to solve coding
                problems, develop new features and design new websites using
                different mediums. My work is mainly focused on
                frontend-development. As for a developer, my work mainly
                involves coding in different ways. Besides, I also like doing
                photography and racing, where I love to spend some time in my
                hobbies.
